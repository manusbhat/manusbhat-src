Welcome to my competitive programming grading server! All problems are written entirely by me, but some of them are somewhat canonical or take inspiration from other sources. 

Here's how the rating system works (it is meant to somewhat follow USACO):
- 0 to 100: Pre-bronze problems
- 100 to 200: Bronze problems
- 200 to 300: Silver problems
- 300 to 400: Gold problems
- 400+: Platinum problems

I would not consider myself skilled enough to create Platinum problems, so most problems are $100$ to $400$. 

Ratings are further divided into subdivisions:
- 0 to 30: These questions typically use some concepts of the division, but do not require that much lateral thinking.
- 40 to 60: These questions typically require some lateral thinking, and are the sort of questions you should expect in contest
- 70 to 90: These questions typically are somewhat painful and are representative of the hardest of the questions you might see in contest. In many cases, a problem rated $290$ may be more difficult than one rated $310$.

Some important points:
- Problems are not thoroughly tested, and it is entirely possible my checker is wrong for certain questions
- I do not spend a lot of effort on test cases. It is possible you received full credit when the solution is actually suboptimal (either because constants are weak or generated data is weak)
- While I have restrictions in place, please do not submit code that attempts to harm the server
- I only test the limits with C++, if you submit Python or Java, there is no guarantee there exists a solution that will pass the limits
- Due to me basically hard coding the file name on the grading server, for Java, all submissions must be named `main.java`. Update: Java has been disabled entirely as it hasn't been easy to get it to work with virtual memory limits

Please feel free to contact or submit a GitHub issue for any questions or concerns!
